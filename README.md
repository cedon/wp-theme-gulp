#  WordPress Theme Development Gulp Script

A simple Gulp script that sits in a separate directory that responds to a `--theme` parameter to specify which directory to look for source files.

This script is based off of [Morten Rand-Hendrickson](http://mor10.com/)'s Gulp script used in his course on [Lynda.Com](https://www.lynda.com), [WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores](https://www.lynda.com/WordPress-tutorials/WordPress-Building-Themes-from-Scratch-Using-Underscores/491704-2.html)
